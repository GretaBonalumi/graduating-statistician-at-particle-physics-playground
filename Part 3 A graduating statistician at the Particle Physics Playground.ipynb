    "In this final activity, I am required to reconstruct top quarks from jets and, to do this, I shall follow the same approach adopted for Activity 02 in Part II. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will first perform the analysis on MC simulated data, then on real data from the CMS experiment. This is pretty large in size, as it comprises almost half million collisions. Due to the large number of observations, I shall apply the functions **get_min_particles**, **get_combinations** and **get_parent_attributes** only to the first one-hundred thousand observations (in an attempt to do this on the whole dataset, the list of selected collisions was not obtained even after one hour and half!). It will be interesting to see functions in action with particles whose charge is defined by *np.nan*. As a final step, I will plot the masses resulting from the two reconstruction processes using superimposed histograms."

    "The histograms show that the reconstruction process was more successful using MC simulated data, since the peak occures here at about 172 $GeV/c^2$, very close to the actual mean rest mass of top quarks (172.76 $GeV/c^2$ according to Wikipedia). The peak for masses reconstructed using the CMS data occurs instead at about 195 $GeV/c^2$, farher from the actual mean value. I strongly suspect that this difference is due to the small sample size, since only 954 collisions out of the original one-hundred thousand could be retained and this in turn allowed to reconstruct a much lower number of parent particles. It is likely that, using the whole dataset, the peak would occur at the expected mass value. This could easily be done by applying the functions **get_min_particles**, **get_combinations** and **get_parent_attributes** to blocks of one-hundred thousand collisions at a time and then appending the resulting dataframes to each other. This procedure would be less time-consuming than applying the functions to the whole dataset at once.\n",

    "## Final thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "This data analysis experience, though simple in aims and surely constrained by my currently limited background knowledge and lack of advanced analysis methods for Physics datasets, taught me a lot, both about the interesting field of high-energy particles (whose properties became now much more familiar to me) and getting confidence in applying the coding skills I previously acquired. Managing to reconstruct many of the parent particles was a reason of great satisfaction and, even in the activities where the results I got were different from those expected, I enjoyed trying to figure out ways to make hypotheses about possible alternative explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found myself particularly committed in the stage of defining my three functions: I was creating something more complex (and, hopefully, useful) and I was determined to succeed. Defining the functions was a process that I carried out in successive steps. At first, I performed the reconstruction process of $D^+$ mesons from MC simulated data by writing lengthy code limited to that task, then I had the insightful idea that I could approach this and the next reconstruction tasks by writing functions that could perform the different operations at once. Finding the optimal form for the operations each function would perform was also a discover that happened in successive stages, involving different initial drafts that led to the final code. One drawback of the functions was the long computation times they took (about ten minutes for one-hundred thousand collisions). Although this might be due to the size of the datasets, I am sure that there must be a more efficient way to define them so that results could be obtained faster. This will surely be one of the next milestones in my coding journey!"
