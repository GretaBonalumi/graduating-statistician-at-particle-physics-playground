    "## Activities 02 and 03: a new approach is required that is not limited to single tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Activities 02 and 03 represented for me a quality leap compared to Activities 00 and 01, due to the complexity of the code required to carry them out more efficiently (at least in terms of code  amount). Working through them opened the doors to a more committed way to code, which passed from being the mere execution of an isolated task to becoming a comprehensive strategy capable to speed up data manipulation, extraction and computation in the context of particle reconstruction. In other words, I decided to approach the last two activities by defining functions capable to:\n",
    "1) selecting the collisions (from the list created by **pps.get_collisions**) which generated the minimum number of particles with a specified charge (if applicable) required by the decay mode (function **get_min_particles**);\n",
    "\n",
    "2) forming, for each selected collision, all the possible combinations of particles in accord with the specified decay mode (function **get_combinations**);\n",
    "\n",
    "3) extracting and summing, for each particle combination, the energy and momentum in the $x$-, $y$- and $z$-directions of the daughter particles to determine the energy, magnitude of momentum and mass of the parent particle (function **get_parent_attributes**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of creating ad hoc functions was motivated mainly by the presence of multiple datasets on which the same reconstruction process had to be performed, but the task soon became a self-challenge where I tried to creatively build something new by putting together all my knowledge as a junior Pythonist. What have I learnt from this? That, to create something new, we shouldn't be afraid to dare!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting ready for Activities 02 and 03\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the ordinary modules that I imported for the first two activities, specific functions from two additional modules will be imported directly by the code that defines the aforementioned functions. These are the function **deepcopy** from the **copy** module (to ensure the preservation of the original list and the generation of a deepcopy of it on which the function **get_min_particles** will operate) and the functions **combinations()** and **product()** from the **itertools** module (which will play a primary role when defining the function **get_combinations**)."

This action is repeated for all the types of charged particles, creating a list of combinations (stored as tuples) for each. It then uses **itertools.product** to perform the Cartesian product between each combination of particles of a certain type and charge with all the combinations of particles of the other types and charges. After suitable flattening, the final object is a list of lists, where each sublist is a combination of particles from which data can readily be extracted for the reconstruction process.

    "The histogram in Figure 2 leaves no doubt that the reconstruction process of $D^0$ mesons succeeded: the peak occurred exactly where expected, at about 1.86 $GeV/c^2$, comparing with a real mean value of 1.8648 $GeV/c^2$ (according to Wikipedia). We can observe that the decay mode through which the highest number of $D^0$ mesons was reconstructed is the $K^- \\pi^+$ mode (the peak comprises about 25000 units), while the $K^+K^-$ and $\\pi^+\\pi-$ modes (which performed pretty similarly, with the latter having produced a slightly higher peak of about 6000 units) captured a lower number of parent particles."

    "It is very interesting to note that, while the reconstruction process succeeded to reconstruct $D^0$ mesons, this is not the only peak that could be identified. There are two other smaller peaks generated by the parent particles reconstructed via $K^- \\pi^+$ and $\\pi^- \\pi^+$ decay modes, respectively a bimodal peak centred at 0.4 $GeV/c^2$ and a peak at 0.8 $GeV/c^2$. These are lower in height (about 6000 and 6500 units compared to the 25000 of the peak for the masses of $D^0$ mesons via the $K^- \\pi^+$ mode). However, comparing the mass values at which these minor peaks occur with those of the known particles in the Standard Model of Elementary Particles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle#/media/File:Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg), I couldn't find any correspondence. It may be hypothesised that these peaks correspond to the total mass of multiple particles that in turn decayed into kaons and pions, or that they are due to random variation.\n",

    "It can immediately be observed that the masses of the parent particles reconstructed via the $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^0$ decay mode have extremely large values compared to those reconstructed via the other decay modes. Since the sample size is very small, these masses will not be investigated visually. Prior visual exploration revealed also that the peak generated by the particles reconstructed via the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decay mode is very high compared to the peaks for the other modes, due to the substantial number of combinations (and hence of parent particles) it yielded. I will therefore plot these data separately (Figure 4), not to obscure the pattern in the masses from the $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$, $K^+K^-$ and $K^-\\pi^+$ decay modes. Since these three modes are instead reasonably comparable in range and size, there is no point not in plotting them together (Figure 5). The histograms related to the same decay mode will be coloured in the same way both for MC simulated data and real CLEO data, so as to facilitate comparisons."

Interestingly, this is the same position at which the unexpected peak of masses of parent particles reconstructed through the same decay mode, but from MC simulated data, occurred (see Figure 3). We may interpret this as an indication that the peak may not be caused by simple random variation: it seems to be the clue of a particle! At this stage, however, I lack the knowledge and analysis tools necessary to infer more deeply about this issue."

    "Like in the histogram in Figure 4, none of the peaks of the masses of particles reconstructed via the decay modes depicted here corresponds to the mass of $D^0$ or $D^+$ mesons. The peak related to the $K^-\\pi^+$ decay mode is located at about 0.8 $GeV/c^2$, right as the peak in the corresponding histogram from MC simulated data: another suggestion of an actual particle rather than simple random variation! The modest peak for the $K^+K^-$ decay mode, located at about 1.66 $GeV/c^2$, is not so far from the mean value of the mass of $D^0$ mesons. It is possible that these parent particles do correspond to $D^0$ mesons, but that the small sample size caused the true location of the peak to be underestimated. Unfortunately, this hypothesis could be verified only having more collisions containing at least one negative kaon and one positive kaon.\n",
    "The most noticeable peak is related to the $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ decay mode for $D^+$ mesons but, again, is not located at the expected mass value, rather at about 1.12 $GeV/c^2$. The elementary particle whose mass is closest to this value is the charm quark (1.275 $GeV^2$, according to Wikipedia) but, again, my actual knowledge is insufficient to check whether this is a reasonable interpretation."
