# graduating-statistician-at-particle-physics-playground
Properties of elementary particles are investigated visually and particle reconstruction is performed in the context of High-Energy Physics using Python code.
The repository contains three Jupyter notebooks with my work through the first four activities proposed at the Particle Physics Playground website. The project consists in the visual exploration of the energy and magnitude of momentum of elementary particles in the context of High-Energy Physics. Particle reconstruction via different decay modes is also performed and assessed by visually exploring the masses of the reconstructed parent particles, using both real and Monte Carlo simulated data. The experiments involved are the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid at LHC at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland) and the CLEO detector (at the CESR at the Cornell University in Ithaca, State of New York). The main aim of the project is getting some hands-on experience about the work of a data scientist, but I will also take it as a valuable occasion to get to know more closely the world of high-energy particles.
